This is the MultiUser Resume Project
an offshoot of the original Resume-Web by Neo Melonas.

To set up the system, make a copy of <code>settings.default.php</code>
from the conf directory and name it <code>settings.php</code>.  Within
the new file, edit everything above the Do Not Edit lines and the
database connection and server-side linkages should be working.

Hopefully, you will have named your database something nice and neat
(think <code>resume</code>), and you won't have edit the SQL files.

The <code>Resume Structure.sql</code> has the DB name "resume"
preloaded, so if you need to change it, do so now.  At some point in
the future, there will be a blank SQL Inserts file waiting for your
juicy data, but for now, examine your newly tabled database and add
data as necessary.

There are plans for a port of this to get back to the roots and be a
"single user" resume site.  It'll be released, eventually, I guess.

Enjoy!
